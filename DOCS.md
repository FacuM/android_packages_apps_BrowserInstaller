Welcome to the BrowserInstaller wiki!

What's this?
* We thought that no one used the browser included in the ROM, so we built this to let the users decide which browser to use in a rost of the most used browsers by the community.

Cool, I don't get the in-app tutorial tho.. Can you give me more details on how use this thing?
* Sure! First of all you should just pass the welcome screen by tapping the big button in the center of your screen. After you'll be asked to grant the app the permission to access your device's storage: This is needed because we'll need to download the browser you chose from our server if you didn't install any Gapps package.
Now just tap on one of the icons there and we'll do all the work for you, from downloading to installing you'll just have to grant us all the permissions we ask for.
* Note: The Chromium icon stands for CAF Chromium
